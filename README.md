# EdgeX

> A tribute to Xposed Edge. EdgeX is an LSPosed/Xposed edge gesture module for Android 15+ that hooks system input and SystemUI so edge gestures, hardware keys, and common Android actions can be configured in one place.

## Overview

EdgeX is not a regular floating-window utility. The app process is only the configuration surface; the module logic runs entirely inside the `system_server` process injected by LSPosed/Xposed:

- `android` (system_server): edge touch handling, hardware key interception, all action dispatch, freezer drawer, clipboard history overlay, universal copy overlay, and other system-side surfaces.
- `com.fan.edgex`: settings UI and cross-process configuration storage.

It is intended for rooted LSPosed users who want Xposed Edge-style shortcuts on modern Android: Back, Home, Recents, screenshots, app launch, app shortcuts, shell commands, freezer drawer, clipboard history, universal copy, and more.

## Features

- **Edge gestures**: segmented left, right, top, and bottom edge zones, plus full-edge low-priority zones.
- **Gesture events**: single tap, double tap, long press, and directional swipes.
- **Hardware keys**: configure click, double-click, and long-press actions for Volume Up, Volume Down, and Power.
- **System actions**: Back, Home, Recents, notifications, lock screen, screenshot, volume, brightness, and more.
- **Apps and shortcuts**: launch selected apps or app shortcuts, with a root fallback for restricted shortcut discovery.
- **Pie and custom panels**: open radial Pie menus or custom panels from gestures and keys.
- **Action workflows**: save multiple-action combinations and run conditional actions for more flexible automation.
- **App switching**: switch directly to the previous or next recent app.
- **Freezer drawer**: manage frozen apps, open a side drawer, unfreeze and launch apps, then refreeze them.
- **Clipboard history**: show the last 50 clipboard entries in a bottom-sheet overlay; tap any entry to inject it into the focused field, or delete individual entries.
- **Universal copy**: collect accessible text from the current screen and copy selected text blocks from an overlay.
- **Shell commands**: bind custom commands to gestures or keys, with optional `su` execution.
- **Media controls**: play/pause, stop, previous track, and next track.
- **Debug and theming**: gesture-zone debug overlay, SystemUI restart shortcut, haptic feedback on action trigger, and configurable accent colors.

## Requirements

- Android 15 or later.
- LSPosed / Xposed environment with Xposed API 82 or later.
- Current build config: `minSdk 35`, `targetSdk 36`, `compileSdk 36`.
- Required LSPosed scope:
  - `android` / System Framework (system_server)

### Root Notes

- Freezing and unfreezing apps usually requires Root. EdgeX uses framework access where possible and falls back to `su`-backed flows where needed.
- App shortcuts are loaded through Android APIs first. If access is restricted, EdgeX may use `dumpsys shortcut`, which usually requires Root.
- Shell commands only need Root when the command itself needs it or when the action is configured to run through `su`.
- ROM changes, SELinux policy, and LSPosed runtime behavior can affect individual actions.

## Installation

1. Install the EdgeX APK.
2. Enable EdgeX in LSPosed.
3. Select the `android` (System Framework) scope.
4. Reboot the device. A full reboot is recommended after first activation or scope changes.
5. Open EdgeX, enable gestures or keys, and assign actions.

## Usage Tips

- Turn on debug mode first if you want to verify where edge zones are being detected.
- If gestures do not trigger, check the LSPosed scopes, module enablement, and whether the device was rebooted after enabling the module.
- If freezer or shortcut fallback actions fail, check `su` authorization and your root manager logs.
- Use the in-app SystemUI restart entry after changing SystemUI-side behavior.

## Tested Environment

| Device                 | Android | Xposed Environment                                             | Root Solution                                 |
|------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Pixel 9                | 16      | [`LSPosed 1.9.2-it(7455)`](https://github.com/LSPosed/Lsposed) | [KernelSU](https://github.com/tiann/KernelSU) |

This is the currently verified development setup, not a strict compatibility limit. Other devices and ROMs may require additional adaptation.
